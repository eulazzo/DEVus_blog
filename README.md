# About

### Sigma - Best way to learn is by teaching what you know

<p>
In this blog I share things about Web and Mobile Development that i'm learning from bootcamps, courses and articles that I occasionally read or subject that i already know. That way I can learn better and maybe end up helping someone else.
<code>The articles are being written in English because I want to improve my English writing skills and I think that's a very good way to do so</code>. Sorry in advance in case you found some typos, that can happen very often. </br></br>  
At the end of each article you can find all the sources I used to learn some specific topic and then make the article itself. For more information just check the link below the articles. :)
